In this Mathematica notebook we (classically) simulate the evolution of the distribution+electric field of a linear and electrostatic plasma. The electric field will experience Landau damping.
See pdf for a print of the notebook.

Abstract: "...By linearizing and assuming a Maxwellian background distribution function, we convert the Vlasov-Maxwell system into a Hamiltonian simulation problem..."
